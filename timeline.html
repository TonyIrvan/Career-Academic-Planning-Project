                <h3>Express two things you can do while at CVCC to better prepare for your career choice.</h3>
                <p>While at CVCC, I can meet with my professors and advisors to better prepare for my career choice. This activity will help me gain insight from professionals, which is crucial for my future profession.</p>
                <p>Additionally, engaging in networking with my peers will allow me to develop connections with individuals in a similar field, enhancing my readiness for the career I aim to pursue.</p>
                
                <h3>Analyze three challenges you anticipate encountering while trying to achieve your plan. Determine possible solutions to address these challenges.</h3>
                <p>One challenge I anticipate is balancing work and study. This challenge may arise due to having a demanding part-time job. To address this, I plan to create a detailed schedule to manage my time effectively, ensuring that I allocate sufficient time for both my job and my studies.</p>
                <p>Another potential challenge is keeping up with coursework. This could be a significant hurdle because the academic workload can be overwhelming at times. My approach to overcoming this challenge is to seek help from tutors and use academic resources provided by the college. Regularly attending study groups and staying in touch with professors will also help me stay on track with my assignments and exams.</p>
                <p>The third challenge I foresee is financial constraints. This may pose difficulties because the cost of tuition and books may be high. To counter this, I consider working part-time. Additionally, I will create a budget plan to manage my expenses wisely.</p>
